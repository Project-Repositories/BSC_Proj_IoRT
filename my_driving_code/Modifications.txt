Ultrasonic.py:
    imported math library
    get_distance()
        made the number of measurements dependent on a variable (hardcoded inside the function)
        Changed the number of iterations to be dependent on this, instead of a constant 3 (3 seemed to be a mistake.)
        the result is either the median value of the measured distances (if number of measurements is odd)
        or the average of the 2 median values (if the number of measurements is even).
        Modified the formula for calculation of the distance
            (following this guide https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04/)
        
    wait_for_echo()
        instead of using the decrementing of a counter in a loop as the timer, we use the time module.

    run_motor()
        made variables, instead of using "magic numbers"

Line_Tracking.py
    run()
        Changed bitwise-or function into arithmetic addition (seemingly not semantically different, so its clearer to read).
        then made code clearer to read, and added direction-change when reaching the end of black tape.
